## ⚡ 0:00 - 0:45 | PART 1: THE HOOK (Urgency & Latar Belakang)
*(Visual: Split screen. Left: A chaotic mix of mismatched YouTube thumbnails. Right: A high-end, cohesive brand like MrBeast or Apple.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"Building a brand is a **billion-dollar problem**. For top creators, it requires an army of designers. For the other 200 million creators? It’s a mess of generic Canva templates and inconsistent vibes."

"Most AI tools are just **'Asset Generators'**—they give you a random masterpiece, but they don't give you a **Brand**."

*(Action: Fast zoom into the Sentient Studio UI—clean, premium, dark mode.)*

"Meet **Sentient Studio**. It’s not a design tool. It’s an **AI Creative Director** built from the ground up on **Gemini 3**. It doesn't just make images; it learns your visual soul."

---

## 🧬 0:45 - 1:45 | PART 2: THE BRAIN (Multimodal DNA Extraction)
*(Action: Open 'Add Image' dialog. Drag & Drop a folder of 10 disparate reference images—Cyberpunk, Neon, Dark Tech.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"Step 1: Onboarding. We don't ask for a brand kit. We extract it from your existing work."

*(Action: Click 'Analyze Brand'. Show 'Thinking' logs pulsing: 'Gemini 3 Multimodal Analyzing pixels...')*

**TECH FLEX:**
"We are feeding raw pixel streams into **Gemini 3 Flash**. Using **Native Multimodal Vision**, our **DNA Agent** isn't just tagging objects—it's deriving **Intent**.
*   *It sees the neon saturation levels.*
*   *It understands the bold sans-serif hierarchy.*
*   *It codifies the 'Tech-Noir' vibe.*"

*(Action: The 'Brand Constitution' panel slides out. Show colors, fonts, and rules.)*

"In 20 seconds, we’ve built a **Brand Constitution**. This is the persistent memory that will govern every pixel we create from now on."

---

## 🎨 1:45 - 3:00 | PART 3: THE STUDIO (Agentic Workflow & Refine)
*(Action: Open 'Generate Image' tab. Prompt: "A high-tech futuristic helmet sitting on a desk." — No style keywords.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"Step 2: Creation. Most AI tools require complex prompt engineering. In Sentient Studio, you just describe the **Subject**. The **Brand** is handled by our Agentic layer."

*(Action: Image generates—it automatically matches the Neon/Dark style from Step 2. Click on the image to activate the **Mask/Refine** tool.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"But we’re more than a generator. We’re a **Studio**. I don't like the light on the visor? I mask it, and tell the AI: 'Make this glow brighter purple'."

*(Action: Show the smooth masking brush and the fast regeneration.)*

"Our **Refine Agent** uses **Gemini 3 Pro Image** to perform surgical edits, maintaining brand consistency even during the refinement process. This is the bridge between AI and Professional Utility."

---

## 🛡️ 3:00 - 4:15 | PART 4: THE MOAT (The Compliance Audit - "The Judge Killer")
*(Action: **THE SABOTAGE.** Manually add a 'Happy Sunshine' yellow sticker or a comic-sans text that clearly violates the Tech-Noir constitution.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"But here is our unfair advantage. What if a collaborator, or the AI itself, breaks the rules?"

*(Action: Click **'Audit Compliance'**. The canvas dims. **RED HEATMAPS** pulse over the yellow sticker.)*

**TECH FLEX:**
"This is the **Compliance Auditor Agent**. It’s comparing the current canvas against the stored **Constitution** using Gemini’s **Thinking Mode**."

*(Action: Hover over the Red Error. Show the tooltip logic: 'Violation: High-key yellow conflicts with neon-noir contrast rules.')*

"This isn't just a filter. It’s **Reasoning**. It’s an AI Creative Director that says 'No' when the work isn't good enough. This is the moat that protects every creator’s identity."

---

## 🚀 4:15 - 5:00 | PART 5: THE VISION (Scale & Impact)
*(Action: Click 'Export'. Show the grid of platform presets: YouTube, IG, TikTok, LinkedIn.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"We’ve solved the consistency gap. From one moodboard, we’ve enabled an entire ecosystem of on-brand, audited, and professional assets."

"We are democratizing agency-grade design for the 200 million creators building the future of media. Powered by the reasoning of Gemini 3."

*(Action: Fade to logo: **Sentient Studio — Your Brand, Sentient.**)*

**SPEAKER:**
"Thank you."
