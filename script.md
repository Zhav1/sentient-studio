# 🎬 Sentient Studio: The "Masterpiece" Demo Script (Gemini 3 Hackathon)

**Theme:** "The AI Creative Director for the Creator Economy"
**Core Duration:** 3:00 (High Content Density)
**Extended Duration:** 5:00 (Includes Technical Deep Dive)

---

## ⚡ 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook: "The Consistency Gap"
*(Screen: Split view. Left: A messy, amateur YouTube channel. Right: MKBHD's perfect grid.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"We all know the difference between a **hobbyist** and a **professional** creator. It's not the camera gear. It's **Brand Consistency**."

"Top creators like MKBHD pay agencies $100k a year to maintain this visual discipline. The other 200 million creators? They're stuck with Canva templates that look like everyone else."

*(Action: Open Sentient Studio empty canvas.)*

"Meet **Sentient Studio**. The first AI Creative Director built entirely on **Gemini 3**. It doesn't just generate images. It **learns, protects, and scales** your brand DNA."

---

## 🧬 0:30 - 1:00 | The Setup: Multimodal Brand Extraction
*(Action: Open 'Add Image' Dialog. Drag & Drop 10 diverse thumbnails from a 'Tech Noir' style channel.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"Watch this. I'm not going to fill out a 50-question brand survey. I'm just going to show it what I've made before."

*(Action: Click 'Add Images'. The canvas fills. Click the **'Analyze Brand'** button in toolbar.)*

"Right now, we are feeding raw pixel data into **Gemini 3 Flash**. We're not using computer vision libraries. We're using Gemini's **Native Multimodal Vision**."

*(Action: Show the 'Thinking' logs expanding in the sidebar.)*

"Look at the reasoning logs. It's not just seeing colors. It's deriving *intent*.
*   'Detecting high-contrast neon purple...'
*   'Noticing sans-serif typography with 80% weight...'
*   'Identifying a Cyberpunk/Tech-Noir aesthetic...'"

*(Action: The 'Brand Constitution' panel slides out, populated with data.)*

"In 15 seconds, it extracted a **Brand Constitution** that would take a human agency two weeks to define."

---

## 🎨 1:00 - 1:45 | The Magic: Constitution-Aware Generation
*(Action: Open 'Generate' Tab.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"Now for the magic. I need a thumbnail for a new video: 'The Future of AI'."

*(Action: Type prompt: "A robotic hand reaching for a glowing microchip." **Note: No style keywords.**)*

"Notice I didn't say 'Cyberpunk style' or 'Use purple'. I just described the *subject*."

*(Action: Click Generate. Show the 'Thinking' log again.)*

"Gemini 3 Pro is acting as the **Creative Director Agent**. It intercepts my prompt, injects the Brand Constitution, and rewrites the request."

*(Visual: The image generates. It is PERFECTLY on-brand (Neon Purple, Dark Background).)*

"Boom. It learned the style from the moodboard and applied it to a totally new concept. Zero prompt engineering required."

---

## 🛡️ 1:45 - 2:30 | The Twist: "The Judge-Killer" (Compliance Audit)
*(Narrative Shift: Slow down for emphasis. This is the technical moat.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"But here is where every other AI tool fails. What if the model hallucinated? Or what if I—the human—mess it up?"

*(Action: **SABOTAGE.** Manually add a bright 'Beige' shape or a 'Cute Kitten' sticker that clearly clashes with the Dark Mode vibe.)*

"I've just broken the brand guidelines. A normal tool would let me export this embarrassment. Sentient Studio won't."

*(Action: Click **"Audit Compliance"**. The screen dims. The **RED HEATMAP** overlays appear.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"This is the **Compliance Agent** (Gemini 3 Flash). It's critically analyzing the canvas against the Constitution."

*(Action: Hover over the Red Zone. Read the tooltip.)*

"Look at that reasoning: *'Violation: Beige Element #4 conflicts with the Strict Dark Mode policy defined in Section 2.'*"

"This is the **Judge-Killer**. It's not just generating pixels; it's **reasoning about brand integrity**."

---

## 🚀 2:30 - 3:00 | The Close (Core Pitch)
*(Action: Delete the bad element. Re-audit (Green Check). Click Export -> Select 'YouTube', 'Instagram Story', 'TikTok'.)*

**SPEAKER:**
"We fixed it. And now, I can export perfectly sized assets for every platform in one click."

"For the first time, a solo creator has the power of a dedicated Design Team. Consistent. Scalable. Protected."

"This is **Sentient Studio**."

---

## 🔬 3:00 - 5:00 | OPTIONAL: Technical Deep Dive (Advanced Track)
*(Use this section if you have a 5-minute slot or for Q&A)*

### 1. The Multimodal Architecture (3:00 - 3:45)
**SPEAKER:**
"Let's look under the hood. We aren't chaining LLMs. This is a pure **Gemini 3 Native** architecture."

*(Action: Show Visual Studio Code `gemini.ts` file or an architecture diagram slide.)*

"We send the entire Canvas DOM as a base64 image stream directly to the model's context window. This allows the **Compliance Agent** to 'see' the canvas exactly as the user does, preserving spatial awareness."

### 2. The Thought Process (3:45 - 4:15)
**SPEAKER:**
"The 'Reasoning Logs' you saw aren't metadata. That is **Gemini 3's Thinking Mode** in action. By exposing the Chain-of-Thought to the user, we build trust. The user learns *why* their brand was rejected, turning the AI into a teacher, not just a tool."

### 3. Future Roadmap (4:15 - 5:00)
**SPEAKER:**
"Our next step is the **Video Audit Agent**. Using Gemini 1.5 Pro's huge context window, we'll scan entire uploaded videos to ensure editing pacing and color grading match the channel's history."

"We are building the Operating System for the Creator Economy."
